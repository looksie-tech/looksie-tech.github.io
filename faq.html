					<h2 class="sub-title faq">WE ARE HERE FOR YOU</h2>
					<p>
						We built Looksie with you, the seller, in mind. If you have any questions or concerns that are not addressed in our FAQs below, drop us a line at <b>info@letslooksie.com</b> !
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">How do I create a seller account?</h2>
					<p>
						It’s super-fast and simple! Download the Looksie Seller app on the App Store and create an account. It should take you no more than 5 minutes. Once you’re done, you’ll be able to setup your store, list your products and use all the business tools available. Try it out! 
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">I don’t have a business license… can I still sell on Looksie?</h2>
					<p>
						Absolutely! You don’t need to have a business license to sell on Looksie. Just upload an image of your ID during your account registration and you’ll be ready to go! 
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">Why do you ask for my ID/business documents?</h2>
					<p>
						Our aim is to maintain a trusted marketplace for all buyers and sellers, and these documents will help us do just that!
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">What are the fees?</h2>
					<p>
						We currently have the lowest marketplace fees in the country and, for a limited time, are charging 0% referral fees. You’ll just need to pay for payment processing, which btw, are also low… like… lower than most. We understand that life can get very tough (trust us… we know) and we don’t want to make it any tougher for anyone. In short, we care about your margins. 
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">You can find the specific payment processing fees below:</h2>
					<p>
						<b>KNET: </b><br />
						0.50% with a minimum of 100 Fils.<br />
						<b>Visa/Master: </b><br />
						Local (Kuwait): 2.40% + 100 Fils.<br />
						Regional (GCC):  2.75% + 100 Fils.<br />
						Global (International): 2.75% + 100 Fils

					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">How will I get paid?</h2>
					<p>
						Payments will be initiated every Sunday for all deliveries that took place two weeks earlier. <br /> 
						<b>For example: </b><br />
						Let’s say you made 7 deliveries between September 5 and September 11, totaling $70. We will initiate the payment for those deliveries ($70 minus fees) two weeks after September 11 – So the payment will be initiated on September 26th.

					</p>
					<p>
						Let’s say you made another 7 deliveries between September 12 and September 18, totaling $70. We will initiate the payment for those deliveries two weeks after September 18th – So September 3rd (one week after your previous payment on September 26th).
					</p>
					<p>
						You will continue to receive payments on a weekly basis.
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">What happens if I don’t agree with the amount deposited into my bank account?</h2>
					<p>
						You’ll have 7 days to dispute every payout by clicking on the dispute icon in the payouts screen (in profile settings), or you may contact us directly by email or phone. We will work with you to understand and solve any concerns you may have regarding your payouts.
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">What can I sell on Looksie?</h2>
					<p>
						You can sell pretty much anything as long as it does not violate our terms and conditions. 
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">Do you offer delivery/warehousing services?</h2>
					<p>
						We are not currently offering delivery/warehousing services. However, it is definitely on our agenda, and we just need more time to set things up! 
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">I’m not convinced. Why should I sell on Looksie?</h2>
					<p>
						 It’s the best way to sell. But don’t take our word for it - try it out. It’s super easy and fast to set up, and it’s just as easy to delete your account if you don’t like it! And if you don’t, we’d love to hear your opinion on how we can create a more ideal marketplace for you. We are continuously making improvements and adding new features, and the more feedback we get, the better Looksie will be.
					</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
					<h2 class="sub-title faq">Is Looksie available outside of Kuwait?</h2>
					<p>
						Looksie is currently only available to shoppers and sellers in Kuwait. However, we are working on expanding to regional and international markets soon. So, buckle up!
